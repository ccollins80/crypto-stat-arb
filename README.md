# Crypto Statistical Arbitrage

A reproducible framework for discovering and backtesting crypto **stat-arb** opportunities (pairs trading / mean reversion) using exchange data. The goal is to demonstrate a complete research pipeline suitable for a quant portfolio or resume.

## TL;DR
- Pull OHLCV from exchanges (via `ccxt`)
- Test pair relationships (cointegration / spread stationarity)
- Trade a z-score mean-reversion signal with risk controls
- Backtest with realistic costs, slippage, and position sizing
- Report PnL, drawdowns, Sharpe, turnover, and per-pair diagnostics
